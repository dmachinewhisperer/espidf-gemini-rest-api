Brief: Breaking Gods, Chapter 1 of Purple Hibiscus 
Things started to fall apart at home when my brother, Jaja, did not go to communion and
 Papa flung his heavy missal across the room and broke the figurines on the étagère. We had just
 returned from church. Mama placed the fresh palm fronds, which were wet with holy water, on the
 dining table and then went upstairs to change. Later, she would knot the palm fronds into sagging
 cross shapes and hang them on the wall beside our gold-framed family photo. They would stay there
 until next Ash Wednesday, when we would take the fronds to church, to have them burned for ash.
 Papa, wearing a long, gray robe like the rest of the oblates, helped distribute ash every year. His line
 moved the slowest because he pressed hard on each forehead to make a perfect cross with his ash
covered thumb and slowly, meaningfully enunciated every word of “dust and unto dust you shall
 return.”
 Papa always sat in the front pew for Mass, at the end beside the middle aisle, with Mama, Jaja,
 and me sitting next to him. He was first to receive communion. Most people did not kneel to receive
 communion at the marble altar, with the blond lifesize Virgin Mary mounted nearby, but Papa did. He
 would hold his eyes shut so hard that his face tightened into a grimace, and then he would stick his
 tongue out as far as it could go. Afterward, he sat back on his seat and watched the rest of the
 congregation troop to the altar, palms pressed together and extended, like a saucer held sideways, just
 as Father Benedict had taught them to do. Even though Father Benedict had been at St. Agnes for
 seven years, people still referred to him as “our new priest.” Perhaps they would not have if he had
 not been white. He still looked new. The colors of his face, the colors of condensed milk and a cut
open soursop, had not tanned at all in the fierce heat of seven Nigerian harmattans. And his British
 nose was still as pinched and as narrow as it always was, the same nose that had had me worried that
 he did not get enough air when he first came to Enugu. Father Benedict had changed things in the
 parish, such as insisting that the Credo and kyrie be recited only in Latin; Igbo was not acceptable.
 Also, hand clapping was to be kept at a minimum, lest the solemnity of Mass be compromised. But he
 allowed offertory songs in Igbo; he called them native songs, and when he said “native” his straight
line lips turned down at the corners to form an inverted U. During his sermons, Father Benedict
 usually referred to the pope, Papa, and Jesus—in that order. He used Papa to illustrate the gospels.
 “When we let our light shine before men, we are reflecting Christ’s Triumphant Entry,” he said that
 Palm Sunday. “Look at Brother Eugene. He could have chosen to be like other Big Men in this
 country, he could have decided to sit at home and do nothing after the coup, to make sure the
 government did not threaten his businesses. But no, he used the Standard to speak the truth even
 though it meant the paper lost advertising. Brother Eugene spoke out for freedom. How many of us
 have stood up for the truth? How many of us have reflected the Triumphant Entry?”
 The congregation said “Yes” or “God bless him” or “Amen,” but not too loudly so they would
 not sound like the mushroom Pentecostal churches; then they listened intently, quietly. Even the babies
 stopped crying, as if they, too, were listening. On some Sundays, the congregation listened closely
 even when Father Benedict talked about things everybody already knew, about Papa making the
 biggest donations to Peter’s pence and St. Vincent de Paul. Or about Papa paying for the cartons of
 communion wine, for the new ovens at the convent where the Reverend Sisters baked the host, for the
 new wing to St. Agnes Hospital where Father Benedict gave extreme unction. And I would sit with
 my knees pressed together, next to Jaja, trying hard to keep my face blank, to keep the pride from
 showing, because Papa said modesty was very important.
Papa himself would have a blank face when I looked at him, the kind of expression he had in the
 photo when they did the big story on him after Amnesty World gave him a human rights award. It was
 the only time he allowed himself to be featured in the paper. His editor, Ade Coker, had insisted on it,
 saying Papa deserved it, saying Papa was too modest. Mama told me and Jaja; Papa did not tell us
 such things. That blank look would remain on his face until Father Benedict ended the sermon, until it
 was time for communion. After Papa took communion, he sat back and watched the congregation walk
 to the altar and, after Mass, reported to Father Benedict, with concern, when a person missed
 communion on two successive Sundays. He always encouraged Father Benedict to call and win that
 person back into the fold; nothing but mortal sin would keep a person away from communion two
 Sundays in a row.
 So when Papa did not see Jaja go to the altar that Palm Sunday when everything changed, he
 banged his leatherbound missal, with the red and green ribbons peeking out, down on the dining table
 when we got home. The table was glass, heavy glass. It shook, as did the palm fronds on it.
 “Jaja, you did not go to communion,” Papa said quietly, almost a question.
 Jaja stared at the missal on the table as though he were addressing it. “The wafer gives me bad
 breath.”
 I stared at Jaja. Had something come loose in his head? Papa insisted we call it the host because
 “host” came close to capturing the essence, the sacredness, of Christ’s body. “Wafer” was too secular,
 wafer was what one of Papa’s factories made—chocolate wafer, banana wafer, what people bought
 their children to give them a treat better than biscuits.
 “And the priest keeps touching my mouth and it nauseates me,” Jaja said. He knew I was looking
 at him, that my shocked eyes begged him to seal his mouth, but he did not look at me.
 “It is the body of our Lord.” Papa’s voice was low, very low. His face looked swollen already,
 with pus-tipped rashes spread across every inch, but it seemed to be swelling even more. “You
 cannot stop receiving the body of our Lord. It is death, you know that.”
 “Then I will die.” Fear had darkened Jaja’s eyes to the color of coal tar, but he looked Papa in
 the face now. “Then I will die, Papa.”
 Papa looked around the room quickly, as if searching for proof that something had fallen from the
 high ceiling, something he had never thought would fall. He picked up the missal and flung it across
 the room, toward Jaja. It missed Jaja completely, but it hit the glass étagerè, which Mama polished
 often. It cracked the top shelf, swept the beige, finger-size ceramic figurines of ballet dancers in
 various contorted postures to the hard floor and then landed after them. Or rather it landed on their
 many pieces. It lay there, a huge leather-bound missal that contained the readings for all three cycles
 of the church year.
 Jaja did not move. Papa swayed from side to side. I stood at the door, watching them. The
 ceiling fan spun round and round, and the light bulbs attached to it clinked against one another. Then
 Mama came in, her rubber slippers making slap-slap sounds on the marble floor. She had changed
 from her sequined Sunday wrapper and the blouse with puffy sleeves. Now she had a plain tie-dye
 wrapper tied loosely around her waist and that white T-shirt she wore every other day. It was a
 souvenir from a spiritual retreat she and Papa had attended; the words GOD IS LOVE crawled over her
 sagging breasts. She stared at the figurine pieces on the floor and then knelt and started to pick them
 up with her bare hands.
 The silence was broken only by the whir of the ceiling fan as it sliced through the still air.
Although our spacious dining room gave way to an even wider living room, I felt suffocated. The off
white walls with the framed photos of Grandfather were narrowing, bearing down on me. Even the
 glass dining table was moving toward me.
 “Nne, ngwa. Go and change,” Mama said to me, startling me although her Igbo words were low
 and calming. In the same breath, without pausing, she said to Papa, “Your tea is getting cold,” and to
 Jaja, “Come and help me, biko.”
 Papa sat down at the table and poured his tea from the china tea set with pink flowers on the
 edges. I waited for him to ask Jaja and me to take a sip, as he always did. A love sip, he called it,
 because you shared the little things you loved with the people you loved. Have a love sip, he would
 say, and Jaja would go first. Then I would hold the cup with both hands and raise it to my lips. One
 sip. The tea was always too hot, always burned my tongue, and if lunch was something peppery, my
 raw tongue suffered. But it didn’t matter, because I knew that when the tea burned my tongue, it
 burned Papa’s love into me. But Papa didn’t say, “Have a love sip”; he didn’t say anything as I
 watched him raise the cup to his lips.
 Jaja knelt beside Mama, flattened the church bulletin he held into a dustpan, and placed a jagged
 ceramic piece on it. “Careful, Mama, or those pieces will cut your fingers,” he said.
 I pulled at one of the cornrows underneath my black church scarf to make sure I was not
 dreaming. Why were they acting so normal, Jaja and Mama, as if they did not know what had just
 happened? And why was Papa drinking his tea quietly, as if Jaja had not just talked back to him?
 Slowly, I turned and headed upstairs to change out of my red Sunday dress.
 I sat at my bedroom window after I changed; the cashew tree was so close I could reach out and
 pluck a leaf if it were not for the silver-colored crisscross of mosquito netting. The bell-shaped
 yellow fruits hung lazily, drawing buzzing bees that bumped against my window’s netting. I heard
 Papa walk upstairs to his room for his afternoon siesta. I closed my eyes, sat still, waiting to hear him
 call Jaja, to hear Jaja go into his room. But after long, silent minutes, I opened my eyes and pressed
 my forehead against the window louvers to look outside. Our yard was wide enough to hold a
 hundred people dancing atilogu, spacious enough for each dancer to do the usual somersaults and land
 on the next dancer’s shoulders. The compound walls, topped by coiled electric wires, were so high I
 could not see the cars driving by on our street. It was early rainy season, and the frangipani trees
 planted next to the walls already filled the yard with the sickly-sweet scent of their flowers. A row of
 purple bougainvillea, cut smooth and straight as a buffet table, separated the gnarled trees from the
 driveway. Closer to the house, vibrant bushes of hibiscus reached out and touched one another as if
 they were exchanging their petals. The purple plants had started to push out sleepy buds, but most of
 the flowers were still on the red ones. They seemed to bloom so fast, those red hibiscuses,
 considering how often Mama cut them to decorate the church altar and how often visitors plucked
 them as they walked past to their parked cars.
 It was mostly Mama’s prayer group members who plucked flowers; a woman tucked one behind
 her ear once—I saw her clearly from my window. But even the government agents, two men in black
 jackets who came some time ago, yanked at the hibiscus as they left. They came in a pickup truck with
 Federal Government plates and parked close to the hibiscus bushes. They didn’t stay long. Later, Jaja
 said they came to bribe Papa, that he had heard them say that their pickup was full of dollars. I was
 not sure Jaja had heard correctly. But even now I thought about it sometimes. I imagined the truck full
 of stacks and stacks of foreign money, wondered if they had put the money in many cartons or in one
huge carton, the size our fridge came in.
 I was still at the window when Mama came into my room. Every Sunday before lunch, in
 between telling Sisi to put a little more palm oil in the soup, a little less curry in the coconut rice, and
 while Papa took his siesta, Mama plaited my hair. She would sit on an armchair near the kitchen door
 and I on the floor with my head cradled between her thighs. Although the kitchen was airy, with the
 windows always open, my hair would still manage to absorb the spices, and afterward, when I
 brought the end of a braid to my nose, I would smell egusi soup, utazi, curry. But Mama did not come
 into my room with the bag that held combs and hair oils and ask me to come downstairs. Instead, she
 said, “Lunch is ready, nne.”
 I meant to say I am sorry Papa broke your figurines, but the words that came out were, “I’m sorry
 your figurines broke, Mama.”
 She nodded quickly, then shook her head to show that the figurines did not matter. They did,
 though. Years ago, before I understood, I used to wonder why she polished them each time I heard the
 sounds from their room, like something being banged against the door. Her rubber slippers never
 made a sound on the stairs, but I knew she went downstairs when I heard the dining room door open. I
 would go down to see her standing by the étagère with a kitchen towel soaked in soapy water. She
 spent at least a quarter of an hour on each ballet-dancing figurine. There were never tears on her face.
 The last time, only two weeks ago, when her swollen eye was still the black-purple color of an
 overripe avocado, she had rearranged them after she polished them.
 “I will plait your hair after lunch,” she said, turning to leave.
 “Yes, Mama.”
 I followed her downstairs. She limped slightly, as though one leg were shorter than the other, a
 gait that made her seem even smaller than she was. The stairs curved elegantly in an S shape, and I
 was halfway down when I saw Jaja standing in the hallway. Usually he went to his room to read
 before lunch, but he had not come upstairs today; he had been in the kitchen the whole time, with
 Mama and Sisi.
 “Ke kwanu?” I asked, although I did not need to ask how he was doing. I had only to look at him.
 His seventeen-year-old face had grown lines; they zigzagged across his forehead, and inside each line
 a dark tension had crawled in. I reached out and clasped his hand shortly before we went into the
 dining room. Papa and Mama were already seated, and Papa was washing his hands in the bowl of
 water Sisi held before him. He waited until Jaja and I sat down opposite him, and started the grace.
 For twenty minutes he asked God to bless the food. Afterward, he intoned the Blessed Virgin in
 several different titles while we responded, “Pray for us.” His favorite title was Our Lady, Shield of
 the Nigerian People. He had made it up himself. If only people would use it every day, he told us,
 Nigeria would not totter like a Big Man with the spindly legs of a child.
 Lunch was fufu and onugbu soup. The fufu was smooth and fluffy. Sisi made it well; she pounded
 the yam energetically, adding drops of water into the mortar, her cheeks contracting with the thump
thump-thump of the pestle. The soup was thick with chunks of boiled beef and dried fish and dark
 green onugbu leaves. We ate silently. I molded my fufu into small balls with my fingers, dipped it in
 the soup, making sure to scoop up fish chunks, and then brought it to my mouth. I was certain the soup
 was good, but I did not taste it, could not taste it. My tongue felt like paper.
 “Pass the salt, please,” Papa said.
 We all reached for the salt at the same time. Jaja and I touched the crystal shaker, my finger
brushed his gently, then he let go. I passed it to Papa. The silence stretched out even longer.
 “They brought the cashew juice this afternoon. It tastes good. I am sure it will sell,” Mama
 finally said.
 “Ask that girl to bring it,” Papa said. Mama pressed the ringer that dangled above the table on a
 transparent wire from the ceiling, and Sisi appeared.
 “Yes, Madam?”
 “Bring two bottles of the drink they brought from the factory.”
 “Yes, Madam.”
 I wished Sisi had said “What bottles, Madam?” or “Where are they, Madam?” Just something to
 keep her and Mama talking, to veil the nervous movements of Jaja molding his fufu. Sisi was back
 shortly and placed the bottles next to Papa. They had the same faded-looking labels as every other
 thing Papa’s factories made—the wafers and cream biscuits and bottled juice and banana chips. Papa
 poured the yellow juice for everyone. I reached out quickly for my glass and took a sip. It tasted
 watery. I wanted to seem eager; maybe if I talked about how good it tasted, Papa might forget that he
 had not yet punished Jaja.
 “It’s very good, Papa,” I said.
 Papa swirled it around his bulging cheeks. “Yes, yes.”
 “It tastes like fresh cashew,” Mama said.
 Say something, please, I wanted to say to Jaja. He was supposed to say something now, to
 contribute, to compliment Papa’s new product. We always did, each time an employee from one of his
 factories brought a product sample for us.
 “Just like white wine,” Mama added. She was nervous, I could tell—not just because a fresh
 cashew tasted nothing like white wine but also because her voice was lower than usual. “White
 wine,” Mama said again, closing her eyes to better savor the taste. “Fruity white wine.”
 “Yes,” I said. A ball of fufu slipped from my fingers and into the soup.
 Papa was staring pointedly at Jaja. “Jaja, have you not shared a drink with us, gbo? Have you no
 words in your mouth?” he asked, entirely in Igbo. A bad sign. He hardly spoke Igbo, and although Jaja
 and I spoke it with Mama at home, he did not like us to speak it in public. We had to sound civilized
 in public, he told us; we had to speak English. Papa’s sister, Aunty Ifeoma, said once that Papa was
 too much of a colonial product. She had said this about Papa in a mild, forgiving way, as if it were
 not Papa’s fault, as one would talk about a person who was shouting gibberish from a severe case of
 malaria.
 “Have you nothing to say, gbo, Jaja?” Papa asked again.
 “Mba, there are no words in my mouth,” Jaja replied.
 “What?” There was a shadow clouding Papa’s eyes, a shadow that had been in Jaja’s eyes. Fear.
 It had left Jaja’s eyes and entered Papa’s.
 “I have nothing to say,” Jaja said.
 “The juice is good—” Mama started to say.
 Jaja pushed his chair back. “Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Mama.”
 I turned to stare at him. At least he was saying thanks the right way, the way we always did after
 a meal. But he was also doing what we never did: he was leaving the table before Papa had said the
 prayer after meals.
 “Jaja!” Papa said. The shadow grew, enveloping the whites of Papa’s eyes. Jaja was walking
out of the dining room with his plate. Papa made to get up and then slumped back on his seat. His
 cheeks drooped, bulldoglike.
 I reached for my glass and stared at the juice, watery yellow, like urine. I poured all of it down
 my throat, in one gulp. I didn’t know what else to do. This had never happened before in my entire
 life, never. The compound walls would crumble, I was sure, and squash the frangipani trees. The sky
 would cave in. The Persian rugs on the stretches of gleaming marble floor would shrink. Something
 would happen. But the only thing that happened was my choking. My body shook from the coughing.
 Papa and Mama rushed over. Papa thumped my back while Mama rubbed my shoulders and said, “O
 zugo. Stop coughing.”
 THAT EVENING, I STAYED in bed and did not have dinner with the family. I developed a cough, and
 my cheeks burned the back of my hand. Inside my head, thousands of monsters played a painful game
 of catch, but instead of a ball, it was a brown leather-bound missal that they threw to each other. Papa
 came into my room; my mattress sank in when he sat and smoothed my cheeks and asked if I wanted
 anything else. Mama was already making me ofe nsala. I said no, and we sat silently, our hands
 clasped for a long time. Papa’s breathing was always noisy, but now he panted as if he were out of
 breath, and I wondered what he was thinking, if perhaps he was running in his mind, running away
 from something. I did not look at his face because I did not want to see the rashes that spread across
 every inch of it, so many, so evenly spread that they made his skin look bloated.
 Mama brought some ofe nsala up for me a little later, but the aromatic soup only made me
 nauseated. After I vomited in the bathroom, I asked Mama where Jaja was. He had not come in to see
 me since after lunch.
 “In his room. He did not come down for dinner.” She was caressing my cornrows; she liked to
 do that, to trace the way strands of hair from different parts of my scalp meshed and held together. She
 would keep off plaiting it until next week. My hair was too thick; it always tightened back into a
 dense bunch right after she ran a comb through it. Trying to comb it now would enrage the monsters
 already in my head.
 “Will you replace the figurines?” I asked. I could smell the chalky deodorant under her arms.
 Her brown face, flawless but for the recent jagged scar on her forehead, was expressionless.
 “Kpa,” she said. “I will not replace them.”
 Maybe Mama had realized that she would not need the figurines anymore; that when Papa threw
 the missal at Jaja, it was not just the figurines that came tumbling down, it was everything. I was only
 now realizing it, only just letting myself think it.
 I lay in bed after Mama left and let my mind rake through the past, through the years when Jaja
 and Mama and I spoke more with our spirits than with our lips. Until Nsukka. Nsukka started it all;
 Aunty Ifeoma’s little garden next to the verandah of her flat in Nsukka began to lift the silence. Jaja’s
 defiance seemed to me now like Aunty Ifeoma’s experimental purple hibiscus: rare, fragrant with the
 undertones of freedom, a different kind of freedom from the one the crowds waving green leaves
 chanted at Government Square after the coup. A freedom to be, to do.
 But my memories did not start at Nsukka. They started before, when all the hibiscuses in our
 front yard were a startling red.
